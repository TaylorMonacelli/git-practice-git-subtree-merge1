Purpose here is to practice git subtree merge.  I keep getting conflict
when trying ``git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit master``.

> You can also do the opposite â€” make changes in the rack subdirectory of
your master branch and then merge them into your rack_branch branch
later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.

from http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging

That passage doesn't say anything about merge conflicts and I keep
getting merge conflicts on the
``git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit master``

step.  So either I'm doing something wrong or I
should just accept it and go with the flow.  I tried reasoning as to why
the conflict is happenning, but I don't see the the light yet.  Hence
this practice script.  I'm trying all combinations to see if I can get
around the conflict without simply resolving the conflict manually.

To test it out, I do this
``
make alias && source ./alias && make
``, then ``m`` to change cd the parent repo ``myproject`` and ``v`` to cd to ``vendor`` repo.
